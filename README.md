### Experience
#### Data Scientist, Fractal Analytics
July 2021 - Present
- **DT-LLM Research**
  - Designed and executed experiments to analyze language generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for non-English languages
  - Designed and executed 10+ experiments comparing various LLMs and translation services across 18+ metrics
  - Performed Hypothesis testing to validate the results and recommend best-performing design
  - Presented detailed analysis and recommendations, enabling the client to make architectural decisions for non-English chatbots serving 1.5 million+ users.
- **MBL Open AI**
  - Assessed the potential of LLMs for automating coding tasks in collaboration with a major international bank.
  - Designed and developed Streamlit applications to demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs in conjunction with Bigquery and Alteryx data and APIs, enhancing automation.
  - Executed POCs using OpenAI's GPT-4, resulting in a remarkable efficiency improvement of approximately 10-100 times in custom code conversion, with an 83% success rate for complex workflows to Python, SQL.       - Additionally, conducted a POC for complex text to BigQuery SQL conversion using GPT-4
- **MG Bot**
  - Created Django backend APIs and RAG framework for a Chatbot based on a personâ€™s persona
  - Created advanced algorithms to parse 100+ word documents into topics for creating a vector database for the persona and utilized Langchain library to create a chatbot.
- **Project Phos**
  - Designed and developed the Smart Verification module for a leading reinsurance firm for automatic verification of usage restrictions on data and ensuring compliance using Deep Learning Algorithms and cloud APIs
  - Automated 70% of the verification process, improving efficiency and reducing manual workload
  - Implemented web scraping and data wrangling techniques to curate high-quality training data for the deep learning model.
  - Created, deployed and managed a deep learning model to enable intent classification of legal text documents, improving the module's functionality and increasing automation by ~100%
  - Created inference pipelines on Azure Databricks to monitor model performance on new data, ensuring consistent accuracy
  - optimized the module code to decrease the execution time of different submodules by up to 5 times
  - **Leadership**: Mentored interns on NLP and Computer Vision for creating POCs and submodules for the project
  - Nominated for "Client Champion Award" for outstanding work
